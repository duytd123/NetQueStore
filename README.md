🍲 Net Que Store – Specialty Food E-Commerce Platform for Students
Welcome to Net Que Store, a web-based e-commerce platform developed using ASP.NET MVC (C#). This project aims to bridge the culinary gap for students living far from home by connecting them with authentic regional specialties through a convenient, personalized, and trustworthy platform.

💡 Project Idea
Why This Idea?
Many students move to big cities for education, leaving behind the comforting taste of their hometown. While regional specialties exist in the market, students face problems such as:

Limited access to authentic, quality local dishes.

Lack of trust in unofficial buying channels.

No personalization for unique culinary preferences.

Our solution provides:

A dedicated platform for regional specialties.

Safe, fast, and affordable access to trusted local food products.

📊 Market Analysis
Students studying away from home, especially in urban centers like Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang.

Young users who prefer online shopping and value cultural and culinary authenticity.

🔍 Market Gaps
Lack of platforms targeting student-specific needs in local specialty delivery.

Limited use of AI-powered personalization in existing e-commerce food platforms.
