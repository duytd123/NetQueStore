🍲 Net Que Store – Specialty Food E-Commerce Platform for Students
Welcome to Net Que Store, a web-based e-commerce platform developed using ASP.NET MVC (C#). This project aims to bridge the culinary gap for students living far from home by connecting them with authentic regional specialties through a convenient, personalized, and trustworthy platform.

💡 Project Idea

-Limited access to authentic, quality local dishes.

-Lack of trust in unofficial buying channels.

-No personalization for unique culinary preferences.

-Our solution provides:

-A dedicated platform for regional specialties.

-Safe, fast, and affordable access to trusted local food products.
